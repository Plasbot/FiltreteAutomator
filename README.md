Automate Filtrete smart wifi thermostat
The backroom of my house gets cold faster than the rest of the house.  Unfortunately the thermostat is in the center of the house
and the heater rarely cycles, all the while the backroom is getting frigid. In the past I would just turn on the fan and let it 
run all night so the air would circulate.  This aggravates our allergies for some reason though.  
So what this program does is monitor the weather and when it gets down below a certain temperature outside,
it begins a cycle of turning on the fan every 45 minutes and runs it for 10 minutes.  
Later I might add something to make switch the mode back to cool if the weather changes back to hot as it is prone to do.  Texas
weather is unpredictable.
